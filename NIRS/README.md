# fNIRS setup

These are some config files found on the computer, where the fNIRS device was setup.
They seem to contain hardware configurations.

Default experimental layout is included in `channel_masking`, and it seems important.

There seems to be no Zebris montage file. This contains the 3D positions of the optodes (or channels, idk). It is useful for analysis with MNE.

Installation files are ordered in fNIRS computer.
